# sort-visualizer
Practical program to watch sorting algorithms sort.

## About the project
This program brings sorting algorithms to life! Watch as a list of numbers transforms into
a bar chart and gets sorted right before your eyes. You can explore various algorithms,
adjust the sorting speed, and experiment with different list sizes. It's an interactive and fascinating way
to learn how sorting works!
In the **future**, **more algorithms** are to come.

## Features
- **Speed:** Adjust the speed of the sorting process.
- **Size:** Adjust the size of the list sorted.  
- **Algorithms:** Choose from various algorithms.

And all this nicely visualized!

## Explanation
- ![Choose the algorithm here](src/main/resources/images/sorter.png) Choose your algorithm here.
- ![Randomize the list here](src/main/resources/images/randomize.png) Click here to randomize the data.
- ![Start sorting here](src/main/resources/images/sort.png) Start the sorting process here.
- Adjust the speed of the process or the size of the list with the corresponding slider in the program.
